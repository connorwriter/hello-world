My name is Connor, I am a human, I like doing something called reading.
Reading is when you look at symbols on a flat surface, using a part of the body called the eyes.

People who can't read won't be able to deduce the meaning from the symbols; people who can read, will.
If you can read, you can understand symbols no matter what surface they are on; paper, a monitor, plastic, wood, metal.

The best things to read are something usually printed on paper, called books.
A book is a collection of letters, letters are a group of symbols that represent speech.
Some books are stories; they are called fiction. Others have instructions and information in them; they are called non-fiction.
The longest fiction book in the world is called 'A la recherche du temps perdu'. It is written by a man called Marcel Proust. It has 9,609,000 letters inside.

Even if a person can read, they still might not understand the letters that are written inside 'A la recherche du temps perdu'.
That is because Marcel Proust wrote his book in a language called French.

A language is a collection of letters, ordered into patterns of words. A word is a group of letters that give meaning.
Each language uses different words, and sometimes they even use different letters.
If you do not understand French words, you can not read French books. Even if you know how to read.

Some people understand a lot of different languages; they do something called translating.
Translating is when something in one language is recreated in a different language.

The book 'A la recherche du temps perdu' has been translated into other languages, including one called English.
In English, 'A la recherche du temps perdu' is called 'In search of lost time'; In English, 'Marcel Proust' is still called 'Marcel Proust'.
English people can read the book written by Marcel Proust, even if they do not understand French, the language he wrote it in.
